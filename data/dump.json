      "description": "The Weeping Woman (French: Femme an pleurs) is an oil on canvas painting by Pablo Picasso, which he created in France in 1937. The painting depicts Dora Maar, Picasso's mistress and muse. The Weeping Woman was created at the end of a series of paintings that Picasso produced in response to the bombing of Guernica in the Spanish Civil War and is closely associated with the iconography in his painting Guernica. Picasso was intrigued with the subject of the weeping woman, and revisited the theme numerous times that year.[1] This painting, created on 26 October 1937,[2] was the most elaborate of the series. It has been housed in the collection of the Tate Modern in London since 1987.",

They are one of the most important items of hiking gear, since their quality and durability can determine a hiker's ability to walk long distances without injury. Hiking boots are constructed to provide comfort for walking considerable distance over rough terrain. Boots that protect the hiker's feet and heel are recommended. Hiking boots give ankle support and are fairly stiff.[1] A less popular alternative is to use light trainers with thin soles.[citation needed] Footwear should be neither too loose nor too tight, to help prevent blisters and sore feet. Hiking socks that wick sweat from the feet, provide warmth, and cushion the feet are recommended and a thin, inner sock may also help.[1] Most hiking boots are also designed for other outdoor activities such as backpacking, climbing, mountaineering, and hunting.",

They were used for both terrestrial applications and astronomy.\r\n\r\nThe reflecting telescope, which uses mirrors to collect and focus light, was invented within a few decades of the first refracting telescope. In the 20th century, many new types of telescopes were invented, including radio telescopes in the 1930s and infrared telescopes in the 1960s.
